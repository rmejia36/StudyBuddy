Welcome!

We are the newest solution for students of all ages who would like to study for a class or upcoming assessment. StudyBuddy is a mobile application that provides an effective, entertaining and interactive way of reviewing material.

We are still in development but there will be an annoucement soon when we are on the app store!

Want to run the latest stable development build?

Please follow this installation guide to get the app running on your device:

DEPENDENCIES: Node.js, React-Native, Expo-cli

NOTE: If you want to run the app on your mobile device you must install the Expo Go app for the QR code to work:
https://expo.dev/client

OTHERWISE: You can run the app on XCode's Simulator or the Android Studio Emulator.

To begin, you need to clone the repository on your device. Open up your favorite shell enviorment and run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/rmejia36/StudyBuddy;
cd StudyBuddy;
```
Now you need to install all the dependencies:

```
npm install
````
If everything was installed correctly, we can run the app locally with:
```
expo start
```
At this point a node server with the application should be running on your computer. Scan the QR code and it should take you to the Expo App. If you have Simulator or Android AVD installed you can launch them from the expo console.

Keep up to date with the following commands:
```
git status;
git pull;
```
